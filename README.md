#### Tracking Error In Android App With Sentry
Today, I'm going to tell you about a real-time errors tracking in Android application. Most apps usually doesn't use error tracking, and some of them often postpone it, coming back to it after development, writing tests and documentation, and other things.

##### 1. Why do you need Sentry and what is it?

```
Sentry is application monitoring platform helps every developer
diagnose, fix, and optimize the performance of their code.
```

let's look at the reasons why we need it. 

###### The main reasons for developers:

* Getting an instant notification about troubles
* Helping QA Engineers with testing functionality
* Sorting the errors by predefined or custom tags
* Getting rid of risks to ship code with potential bugs
* Quickly finding and fixing production errors

###### The main reasons for business owners:

* Finding where your developers have made mistakes
* Obtain user's feedback 
* Saving money
